<b><color=red><size=30>DON'T place your city within the territory</size></color></b>
Placement of the city within the territory hinders the generation of resources. That is very annoying and bad behavior. Please place the city on the edge or outside of the territory, not within the territory. Edge refers to the boundary of a territory. 
Please make sure to move your city to the appropriate place by midnight on September 22nd. I will send the list of members who need to move city.

<b><color=red><size=30>DON'T attack someone without permission</size></color></b>
Don't attack other players, even if he doesn't belong to any alliance or feels like he's quit this game.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>How to calculate the points</size></color></b>
the points that we can earn is calculated by following expression:
- <b>Fort Points</b> x <b>The number of participants</b>
If we destory Level 5 forts with 10 people then we can earn <b>60pt * 10=600pt</b> by one rally.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>DON'T leave rss nodes with unfinish it</size></color></b>
You can see many half-baked rss nodes in Zone 3. This is very embarrassing. If you find someone leaving without completing the rss nodes, screenshot the evidence and share it in Alliance Chat. He will get punished. If your troops are not sufficient to complete a high level of rss nodes, move away from Zone 3 or mine only low level rss nodes.
