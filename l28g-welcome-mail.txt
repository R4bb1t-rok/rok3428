those who violates the rules will be punished, no excuse will work.

If you have any questions about the contents of the email or the rules of the alliance, please do not neglect to check with the executives. <b>It is both your fault</b> to overlook email and to fail to confirm any unclear points in email. Not surprisingly, not having checked mails can't be any excuse, it's just your fault.
