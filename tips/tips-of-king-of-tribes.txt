<b><color=#246089><size=30>Tips of King of Tribes</size></color></b>
Hello Rally Mongers :))

<b>King of Tribe</b> event will start tomorrow. Rally Mongers are especially looking forward to it. There are many players who can make a strong rally, but surprisingly few know how to do <b>King of Tribe</b> wisely. In particular, many people do not understand the following two points.

<b><color=red><size=30>DO NOT destroy Level 5 Fortress with with less than 3 people</size></color></b>
<b>The number of participants is important, not the number of fortresses destroyed</b>. Level 5 forts will soon run out and should not be consumed with less points.
<b>Use 10 minutes prep time for Level 5 forts</b> to gather as many participants as possible

<b><color=red><size=30>DO NOT fill full the rally</size></color></b>
<b>The number of participants is important, not the number of fortresses destroyed</b>. Please be careful not to fill the rally so that as many people as possible can participate.
If more than half of the rally's capacity is exceeded, it's good that you send 1,000 troops to the rally. It is also a good idea to send only 1 troop.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>How to calculate the points</size></color></b>
the points that we can earn is calculated by following expression:
- <b>Fort Points</b> x <b>The number of participants</b>
If we destory Level 5 forts with 10 people then we can earn <b>60pt * 10=600pt</b> by one rally.

<b><color=#246089><size=20>Note: The points of Fort</size></color></b>
<size=14>- Level 3 Fort: 30pt
- Level 4 Fort: 45pt
- Level 5 Fort: 60pt</size>

Let's do KoT with a smart strategy ;)
