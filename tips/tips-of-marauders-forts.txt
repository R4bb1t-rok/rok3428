<b><color=red><size=30>Very Important Announcement</size></color></b>
First of all, I have to give you a very important announcement. I am very disappointed with part of our members.
Because I saw <b>more than 60 people havem't contributed enough to us</b> in <i>Alliance Mobilization</i>. I took notes of all of such useless people.
When KvK starts, we will re-organize the members of the alliance. Our strong enough members will join LV temporarily, and some people of LV will come LG. 
Unsurprisingly, expulsion from the alliance also means that <b><color=red>entry into Lost Kingdom will be prohibited</color></b>. Players who do not actively contribute do not deserve to stay in Zone 3 as well as the valuable resources of Lost Kingdom. Just we punish them if such people enter Lost Kingdom.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>3rd stage of Pre KvK will start soon</size></color></b>
We can contribute to the kingdom by destroying the Marauders' forts on this stage.
Marauders' fort is almost same as level 5 barb forts but their active skill is bit stronger than level 5 fort.
Therefore, only those who can easily destroy the Level 5 barb forts should make a rally for Marauders' forts.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Tips of this stage</size></color></b>
In the <i>King of Tribes</i> event, the number of participants is most important thing. However <b>the number of forts is most important in this stage</b>. 
So, contrary to <i>King of Tribes</i>, it is most efficient way to <b>destroy it with fewer participants</b>. If we can destroy it with a small number of participants, we can save everyone's AP.

Please contribute to kingdom a lot actively. Or if you won't do it, do something like Farm Ville in zone 1.
