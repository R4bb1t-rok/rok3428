- <b><color=red>DON’T send siege!</color></b>. It only weakens the rally and slows it down.
- The level and ability of the commanders who participate in the rally have <b>no effect on the rally</b>. Only the commanders pair of the rally leader influences the performance of the participating troops.
- The rally leader may specify the kind of troop. In that case, be sure to <b>send only the designated kind of troops</b>. If you send the wrong kind of troops, you may be kicked out of the rally.
- Let's arrive at the preparation time for the rally. You can understand that keeping other participants waiting is a nuisance that wastes their time, can’t you? If the leader continues to hold rallies, it's better to wait in front of the leader's city for the next rally. If you really want to participate in it, <b>send troops to the target forts and wait there to join the rally</b>. <b><color=red>Try to avoid nuisance that wastes people's time</color></b> as much as possible

- The best commanders to use are those with <b>Peacekeeping</b> skills. Let's apply talent tree for barbarians and rallies.
- Set the suits preparation time and the kind of troops that suits your commander.
- It is necessary for you to grasp that <b>how many troops your rally needs</b> to take down the forts. When you want to look into it, I think everyone will help you if you declare that you will test how many troops you need.As a rough indicator, it's good to think that you need twice as many troops as you go up one level.

Happy rallying <3
