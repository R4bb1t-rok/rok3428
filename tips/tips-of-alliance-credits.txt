- Make contribution to alliance technology. You can earn more than 10k points a day
 - Participating in the construction of an alliance. You can earn up to 20k points a day. In particular, flags build slowly at 1troop are very useful for earning credit.
 - Apply other member's help request. You can earn up to 10k points a day

As for the last one, it is important you to help other member's request, but it is also important that everyone to send request of help. Healing troops is very useful to make help request.

As much credit as you earn your inidivudual credit will be added to alliance credit. It’s very easy to understand, right?

We will start to build our second alliance fortress in Zone 3 soon. However our alliance credits are... <b>very poor</b>!!! So, please be active in earning credit. Or I'll break your knees.

Earn credits as much as possible please ;)
