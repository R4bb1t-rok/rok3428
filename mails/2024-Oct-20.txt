Dear great members

<b><color=#246089><size=30>All members can enter Lost Kingdom now</size></color></b>
As I mentioned in my previous email, I would like to express my gratitude again for the many members who respected the rules and contributed to the alliance resources at Home Kingdom. There are many great things in Lost Kingdom. For example, high-level resource nodes, barbarians, and the Guardian. Please enjoy take those.

<b><color=red><size=30>Make a donation to the Alliance Bank</size></color></b>
The specified amount is: <b>5M Foods or 5M Woods or 5M Stones or 3M Golds per week</b>. This is a very small quantity compared to the other kingdom, since only one kind 5M is okay. And it is less than the amount you receive automatically from the our territory.
I don't mind if you donate more, but you can't carry it over that amount to the next week. We set the deadline of it every Friday, so the next deadline is <b><color=red>25th Oct 23:59</color></b>.
Please check the location of the allied bank with the marker. Let's thank <b><color=purple>RonParrot</color></b> for setting up a profile icon that is easy to understand at the bank.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Please be polite, be disciplined</size></color></b>
During KvK, various events are held, and some of our members have possibility to participate in LV to participate in those events. Please note that members who are recognized by the executive will join there, but those who act selfishly, such as trying to join it without permission, will not be able to rejoin us forever. 

By the way, we changed our alliance bio again ;)
