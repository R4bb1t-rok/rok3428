To all the great warriors. 

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Ancient Ruins will open in an hour</size></color></b>
As a result of yesterday's Ready Check email, 45 members expressed their desire to participate in Ruins. I thought it would be difficult to limit the number of people, but LV decided to accept as many members as possible. 

<b>Members who have announced your participation should apply for LV first at 09:30UTC.</b>

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Follow their instruction!</size></color></b>
1. First of all, don't forget to thank them for accepting you.
2. Move your city within walking distance of the gate 5
3. Send your troops in front of the Gate. If you send out more than one unit, you can only join one unit, so let the rest of the units stand by at the gate.
4. Be disciplined and follow the markers to join the war.
