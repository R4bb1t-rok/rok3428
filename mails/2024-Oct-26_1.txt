Hello guys

<b><color=red><size=30>Important Announcement</size></color></b>
Why are there so many members who simply can't read and fully understand the rules and follow them? I find it very silly to write such common sense things over and over again, but there are still a lot of members who behave insanely. The executives are wasting their time interacting with such members. It's really ridiculous thing. I don't want to hear excuses like, <b>"There are other people who do the same thing"</b>. <b>So what? It has nothing to do with you</b>, and probably he has received similar warnings.

<b><color=red><size=30>DON'T steal resource nodes someone coming</size></color></b>
I have experienced more than twenty kingdoms, but no kingdom has ever defined them as good. If you see an arrow pointing at a resource node, you shouldn't steal it. However, it is a waste of time for executives to confirm all the evidence of the damage. Please solve the problem with each other. Before attacking a unit that stole a resource node, send a warning to that person first. Since it is probably the most common accident at Gem deposit, attacking the unit will not cause much damage, so no one will help if the unit carrying out the resource theft is attacked. However, as a good reason to attack, the attacker requires that a screenshot be taken to prove that you sent your troops that resource node first. It's very troublesome, but those who want to attack and punish should do so.
So before and after sending the farming troops, <b>please pay close attention to whether no one is coming to there.</b>

<b><color=red><size=30>DON'T leave the resource node without completing it</size></color></b>
How many times did I say this? Everyone hates criminals who do it. The excuse "I'll finish it later" is meaningless. If so, we need to send the next sampling unit there at the same time.
