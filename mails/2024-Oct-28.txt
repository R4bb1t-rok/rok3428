I would like to inform the members of this week's events.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Donate resources to alliance bank</size></color></b>
The next deadline is <b>1st November UTC</b>. Please donate 5M resources or 3M golds again this time. In addition, <b>the names of all the people who did not donate to the bank before the previous deadline are recorded</b>, so it would be better to donate twice as much.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Date/time of Ancient Ruins</size></color></b>
<b>29th Oct 02:00UTC</b>
<b>30th Oct 18:00UTC</b>
<b>1st Nov 10:00UTC</b>
<b>3rd Nov 02:00UTC</b>
<b>4th Nov 18:00UTC</b>
As you all know, Ancient Ruins is held <b>every 40 hours</b>. I don't know if there will be a war every time, but if there is an announcement that there will be a war, try to participate in the LV at least 30 minutes before the start time. Also, if you want to participate in LV, be sure to <b>keep online during that time</b>. Members who have gone offline even once are at risk of being kicked at any time. This is because there is no reason for those who do not participate in the war to stay at the LV.
