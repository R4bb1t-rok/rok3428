Hello everyone!

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Lost Kingdom has opened</size></color></b>
First of all, as in <b><color=purple>Sixx</color></b> wrote mail, I appreciate the cooperation of preKvK. It is very meaningful that our camp was able to win first and second place. And I am glad that almost everyone is staying in the Home Kingdom according to the rules. Don't worry, I think <b>all the members will be able to participate in Lost Kingdom within two days</b>.
The roles of each member are listed below, so please check them again.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>R4/R3 members in LK</size></color></b>
<b>-</b> Help building
<b>-</b> Clean the barbs, forts and rss nodes in the territory, including a little outside the border of the territory
We need to <b>secure as many TP locations as possible</b>.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Members in Home Kingdom</size></color></b>
<b>-</b> Continue to wait for permission to enter Lost Kingdom
<b>-</b> Keep farming all rss nodes within territory in Zone 3
Farming within the territory is very important to build flags and increase territory within Lost Kingdom. Also, <b>you can progress the farming mission of "Light versus Darkness" even if you do it in Home Kingdom</b>.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Members in LK even though you are not R3/R4</size></color></b>
<b>-</b> Be a free kill point for this kingdom
<b>We don't need selfish people who can't follow the alliance rule</b>. 

Let's enjoy our KvK! :)))
