<b><color=#246089><size=30>Alliance Mobilization has began</size></color></b>

The event is about competing to see how active the alliance is. Many quests are presented at this event, with goals and points for each quest. Everyone in the alliance can accept them, and points are given to the alliance by achieving the quest. <b>Rewards are eventually distributed according to the alliance's ranking</b>.

Also, at the time of writing this email, as far as the individual's performance ranking is concerned, <b>only 13 people have achieved the quest</b>. How many members are there in our alliance? :(

Please actively participate in this event and achieve as many quests as possible. Please achieve at least one. There are no penalties for each person's points, but if the number of people in the alliance is full, they may be kicked first. ;)

<b>Also, please note the following points:</b>

 <b>-</b><b><color=red>Only accept quests that can be achieved please.</color></b> This is the most important thing. 
 <b>-</b> There aren't many of us who charge a lot, so please ask r4 to refresh the quests if you see most quests need spend money.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>For leaders:</size></color></b>

 <b>-</b> You can refresh the quest by pressing the refresh button in the upper right corner of the quest. It will take 5 minutes, but please keep the number of quests that can be achieved without charge

Enjoy this event :))
