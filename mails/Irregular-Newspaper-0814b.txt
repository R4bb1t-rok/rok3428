<b><color=#246089><size=30>Have you received the reward of kvk?</size></color></b>
As I wrote in former mail, we recommended everyone to go back and forth with KOG in order to deepen each other's faith. You all already have been allowed to join KOG and enter Lost Kingdom, but take this opportunity to join KOG to consume "Individual Honor Point" items in your bag and earn honor points for various other actions and receive some rewards. There should be a reward that can be received even just by joining KOG and consuming it. 
Also, I think this is something that you should always do, but don't forget to say a word of thanks when you have other alliances process your acceptance. :)

Has anyone seen the  <b><color=purple>RedKing</color></b> in the past few days? Is he going back to the zoo? I'm worried that he might be missing. Because he is an important friend as one of animal team.

Enjoy rewards <3
