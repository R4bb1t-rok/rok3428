Hello guys

<b><color=red><size=30>Important Announcement</size></color></b>
Why are there so many members who simply can't read and fully understand the rules and follow them? I find it very silly to write such common sense things over and over again, but there are still a lot of members who behave insanely. The executives are wasting their time interacting with such members. It's really ridiculous thing. I don't want to hear excuses like, <b>"There are other people who do the same thing"</b>. <b>So what? It has nothing to do with you</b>, and probably he has received similar warnings.

<b><color=red><size=30>DON'T place your city in the middle of territory</size></color></b>
How many times have I sent this warning so far? I sent it to dozens of people. Why don't you understand that you should put it on the edge, not around of the edge? If you choose the right place, <b>your city should be half out of territory</b>.
And I will stop sending warnings to those who cannot follow the rules. I'm just going to expel you. If you wish to rejoin, do not rely on your alliance shop to get a teleport and move to the correct location immediately after joining. Then, you should start from rank 1 again. 
I've written it many times, but no excuse will work.
