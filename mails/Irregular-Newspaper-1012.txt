<b><color=#246089><size=30>Kaurak event has ended</size></color></b>
The <b><i>Karuak</i></b> event, which was held until yesterday, has ended. While it seemed that we could do only the second boss, the third boss was held an hour before the end of the event. Despite the sudden call, 10 members participated and 7 members obtained two gold statues. Everyone, thank you for your hard work!
<b>Note:</b> As <b><color=purple>Sixxx</color></b> was unlucky, talking about Karuak's rewards is strictly prohibited :)))

<b><color=#246089><size=30>pre-KvK is going very smoothly</size></color></b>
