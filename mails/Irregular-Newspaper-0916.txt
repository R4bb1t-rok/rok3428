<b><color=#246089><size=30>Silk Road event was held</size></color></b>
<b><i>Silk Road</i></b> was held yesterday and we were ranked 1st among all alliances. The one with 99.87% caravan durability left in NIGHTTMARE mode was the best result. We also tried HELL mode once, but unfortunately it failed. Also, don't forget to thank <b><color=purple>Arvix</color></b> and <b><color=purple>Achilles</color></b> for coming to help us with the event!
Also, the <b><i>Clarion Call</i></b> is being held until the end of today, so please don't forget to participate
<b>Note:</b> Screenshots of each successful result have been uploaded to Discord. ;)

<b><color=#246089><size=30>The territory of 1st CF and 2nd AF was connected!</size></color></b>
Were you all aware of that? Some members continued to work to connect our territories,  but it was finally completed. We are pleased that we are ready to make our territory of home kingdom more robust for the next KvK.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Our gold ran out again over again :((</size></color></b>
Almost All Golds disappeared from the our storehouse because of the above mentioned territory connection. Please <b>Mine all gold nodes in territory</b>! You don't love gold? You don't need Gold? It's okay never mind about it, <b><color=red>Anyway, mine all gold nodes in territory!</color></b> Don't be shy to share location of gold nodes if you find free gold nodes in territory. Someone will come to mine it.

Happy gaming <3
