Dear great members

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Kingsland will be opened</size></color></b>
Tomorrow at 02:00 UTC Level 8 Gate will be opened and the war in Kingsland will begin, LG's role is to erect flags and the war will be conducted mainly by LV. For members with low power or without sufficient number of T4s, should stay in LG and help building flags.
First <b>go online at 01:30UTC</b> and wait for executive instructions. The first few hours are very important, right after Kingsland is opened.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Members who build flags in LG</size></color></b>
- <b>FOLLOW THE MARKERS. Don't miss it.</b>
- Offline members can always be kicked out.
- It is forbidden to move a city to Kingsland without permission of the executive, because if a member with low strength moves a city to Kingsland, it will hinder other members to place their cities.
- Don't take time from afar to build the flag. This is because nearby members will not be able to participate in the construction of the flag. Just wait for the construction of the next plane in another flag.
- If you will go offline for an extended period of time, <b>be sure to return the city to another zone</b>.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Members who fight in LV</size></color></b>

- <b>Join the rally and flag defense</b>. <color=red>Don't afraid to lose your troops if you are fighter!</color>. 
- <b>Don't be AFK</b>. If you become offline, you should leave LV.
