<b><color=#246089><size=30>How to prepare for KvK</size></color></b>
<b>-</b> Start saving on AP bottles and speed-ups. 
<b>-</b> Collect resources as much as possible.
<b>-</b> Train a lot of troops as much as possible...to kill them a lot! ;)
All of them will be needed in large quantities in KvK.
<b><color=#246089><size=30>How to contribute to KvK</size></color></b>
<b>-</b> Only those who has well-growned legendary commander and good legendary equipments can fight in open fields.
<b>-</b> Those who don't have above strong commanders should be filler of the rally. Of course it means you kill a lot of troops.
<b>-</b> Donating plenty resources to t5 players.
Without strong commanders and strong equipment, it is not good to fight in open fields. It just giving the enemy many kill points and it will be damage of the kingdom. For such people, sending troops to the rally is a good way to contribute. Of course, it means killing a lot of troops, but there is no other way to contribute to the war.
Other way to contribute KvK is, donate resources to t5 players. T5 players need plenty resources, so everyone should send them plenty resources.
Those are the way to contribute KvK. It means that he who does not do both to kill many troops and to donate many resources does not contribute anything to the kingdom. There may be some punishment under the Kingdom rules for those who contribute nothing despite their high power. I don't think it's necessary to punish such people, but at least I don't think they deserve to get good rewards in a good alliance.
Therefore, please understand that there is a possibility that a certain amount of resources may be required to be donated.

Unfortunately, there are still players who send the wrong troops to the rally. There should be no newbie in our kingdom anymore, right? Can you understand that it's not good to participate in the rally from afar and keep all the participants waiting?
During KvK, the wrong way to participate in the rally can cause fatal losses. You should be able to think carefully about the consequences of your actions and whether they will cause trouble to anyone.

I may have written too harshly, right? The Fighters should not be afraid to kill the troops. Be prepared to enjoy KvK to the fullest!
