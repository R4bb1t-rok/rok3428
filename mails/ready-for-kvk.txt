<b>- Only those who has well-growned legendary commander and good legendary equipments can contribute by fighting in open fields</b>
<b>- Those who don't have above strong commanders should be filler of the rally. Of course it means you kill a lot of your troops.</b>
Those who don't have expertised legendary commanders can't contribute by open field. It just gives other kingdom plenty honor points, it's will be losses of our kingdom.
<b>- Donating plenty resources to t5 players</b>
Therefore, please understand that everyone should donate rss to alliance bank. We will <b><color=red>require everyone to donate a certain amount of resources to their bank accounts every week</color></b>. At a later date, we will determine the amount of resources that should be donated every week and put the marker on the bank account. Everyone needs to follow it.

Unfortunately, there are still players who send the wrong troops to the rally. There should be no newbie in our kingdom anymore, right? 
During KvK, <b><color=red>the wrong way to participate in the rally can cause fatal losses</color></b>. 

Be prepared to enjoy KvK to the fullest!
