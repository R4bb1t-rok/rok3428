It is an event in which members of the alliance protect caravans from enemies and escort them to the finish line. There are multiple levels of difficulty, but if the number of participants and the number of participants is small, you will have to choose a lower level of difficulty. Of course, the more difficult the challenge is, the better the reward is.
 <b>1</b>. First, it is necessary to keep one unit in the circle centered on the caravan. To attack enemy, using another one unit is better.
 <b>2</b>. The enemies who aim for caravans are mostly gray and green.
 <b>3</b>. Sometimes a strong boss-class enemy appears.
 <b>4</b>. Bosses and caravans sometimes drop chests. However, you can't get anything of great value from it, <b>so please ignore it</b>. The damage caused by an accident that overlooks the enemy while acquiring chest is more dangerous.

Basically, all enemies head to the caravan, but once they attack, Gray's enemies stop heading to the caravan and aim at the target they attacked. Green enemies never stop heading to the caravan when they attack. At first glance, green enemies seem more dangerous, but everyone tends to overlook gray enemies because they pay too much attention to them, so the important thing is to <b><color=red>touch the gray enemies and then go and attack the green enemies</color></b>.

Let’s enjoy Silk Road XD
