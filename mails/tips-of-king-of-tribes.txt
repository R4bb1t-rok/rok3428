<b><color=#246089><size=30>Tips of King of Tribes</size></color></b>
First of all, the points that we can earn is calculated by following expression:

- <b>Fort Points</b> x <b>The number of participants</b>

For example, In case that we destroy Level 5 Fort by 10 people, we can earn <b>60 base point x 10 people -> 600 points</b>. So most important thing is, destroy Forts by as many participants.

 <b>Important</b>. <b><color=red>DON’T FILL FULL THE RALLY</color></b> to let many people can join it. 

If you see the rally almost full, it’s better <b>you send only 1 troops>/b>. It is very effective to send only one T1 soldier to a sufficient rally. Because your soldier is wounded and can come back to the city twice as fast as usual. 

If there are so many high-level Forts, it is also effective to destroy many Forts, but the number of high-level Forts is usually limited. Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with preciously. Therefore, please remember that it is very important to <b>get as many points as possible from one Forts</b> during King of Tribes is held.

Depending on the points earned by this event, The kingdom often measures one important thing: <b>Which alliance is very active or not?</b>. Unsurprisingly, inactive alliances should not receive good rewards and do not deserve to have good territory.
So let’s participant the fort rally as much as possible. Or someone might come and slap your cheek XD

<b><color=#246089><size=16>Notes: The points of forts</size></color></b>
<size=14>- Level 3 Fort: 30pt
- Level 4 Fort: 45pt
- Level 5 Fort: 60pt

- Level 7 Fort: 90pt</size>

Happy rallying :))
