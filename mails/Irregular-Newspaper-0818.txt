<b><color=#246089><size=30>We got 2nd Alliance Fortress in Zone 3</size></color></b>
<b>Congrats guys!</b> In addition, we plan to expand our territory little by little, taking into account the credit and resources of our Storehouse. Take this opportunity to develop the habit of paying attention to the alliance's Storehouse, even if you are not an executive.
<b>Important 1</b>: Don't forget to thank the leader of L'28, <b><color=purple>Zam</color></b>, for his cooperation in destroying the fortress himself. But even if we try to burn their flag, they will play tricks such as extinguishing it. Please forgive him, maybe he is in a bit of a bad mood. ;) 
<b>Important 2</b>: As we do not have sufficient territory in Zone 3, we have no choice but to mine resource nodes outside Zone 3 to increase storehouse resources. so we welcome the cooperation of staying in Zone 2 or Zone 1 to mine resources until Zone 3 expands.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>SilkRoad will be held at 12UTC</size></color></b>
I think there will be an announcement of where the event will be held, so please have the two units waiting at the designated place. It will take at least three times, so it will take about an hour. I will email you a detailed explanation of SilkRoad later

<b><color=#246089><size=30>REDKing was found safe</size></color></b>
There was a report that <b><color=purple>REDKing</color></b> , he is one of our leadership and animal team, might be missing but he was found safe. He can't see much because he hides himself in the burrow right away, but it seems that we don't have to worry if we don't see him for a while. :))

Let's enjoy grinding! XD
