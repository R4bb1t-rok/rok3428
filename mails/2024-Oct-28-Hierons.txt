The time to do it is set by the kingdom. However, it is wrong to do it alone even at that time. Please make sure to <b>invite others through the Kingdom Chat</b> before doing so. You can only do it by yourself if there are no other participants after a few minutes of checking in the Kingdom Chat. In that case, please take a screenshot of the chat so that you won't be blamed later.
