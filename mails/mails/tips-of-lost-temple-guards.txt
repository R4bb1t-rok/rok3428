<b><color=#246089><size=30>The guide to join Lost Temple Guardians</size></color></b>
Like other kingdoms, our kingdom has a fixed time to defeat the Lost Temple Guardians together. Don't knock them down alone or ahead of time. 
If you see a player who violates this rule, please send a screenshot to the GOK or L28G leader.

- It will be held twice a day at: <b>08:00 UTC</b> and <b>15:00 UTC</b>
- Gather around the Lost Temple at a <b>set number of soldier</b> a little earlier than the above time. It's very important, but people with <b>War Frenzy</b> should not participate! It is because there is a risk of attacking people from other alliances by mistake.
- At the appointed time, someone becomes the leader and defeats the Guardian one by one. We will all defeat all the Guardians by moving or attacking according to the instructions of the leader.
- The leader will show some kind of attack sign(for ex: attack!), so please wait for that sign and attack the Guardian.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Don't forget to be tolerant</size></color></b>

Some players may not be accustomed to defeating the Guardian in large numbers with other alliances. Until everyone gets used to it, there may be accidents that accidentally attack other players, but please be tolerant of such players. Please do not fight back, just avoiding the attack and leaving that player.
However, players who make the same mistake over and over again may be blacklisted, so be very careful. ;)

- wait for everyone to move before attacking. showing sign is also good. For ex: <i>Follow me!</i> <i>Forward march!</i> or something like that.
- show an attack sign to let everyone attack. For ex: <i>Attack!</i> <i>Charge!</i> or something like that.
