<b><color=red><size=30>Very Important Announcement</size></color></b>
We <b>increased power requirement to 5M</b>. However, not everyone who does not meet the requirements will be expelled immediately. If we need a vacant seat, you will be expelled first. Small farm accounts are particularly easy to target, but you just apply when you want to transfer resources and leave voluntarily when transferring resources is finished. Also it's good that you let your farm account usually participate in LK28.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Crusader Camp</size></color></b>
We will occupy the Crusader Camp today at 14:00 UTC. At that time, <b>some of our members will be kicked temporarily</b> because of the entry and exit of some members from the LV. Those who contribute less to the alliance are eligible. However, it does not mean permanent expulsion, so you can join the alliance again if you apply bac after the event is over.
And some of our members will also go to receive the LV Camp reward. Of course, people who have made a lot of special contributions will be eligible. Don't worry, during this long KvK period, similar opportunities for rewards will come many times. Even if you are not selected this time, you can be on the list next time depending on the degree of your contribution, so please contribute a lot.
