<b><color=#246089><size=30>DON'T violate MGE Score</size></color></b>
As mentioned in the Kingdom Mail and the recent Alliance Mail, the ranking for MGE commanders rewards is fixed. Everyone who wasn't included the list <b>must not exceed 6M points</b>.

<b><color=red><size=24>If you exceed 6M points</size></color></b>
<b>The excuse is not valid</b>. You need to pay 200M resource for 1M or <b><color=red>you get zeroed</color></b>.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>DON'T attack anyone</size></color></b>
The 5th and 6th days of MGE are days when you can earn a score at Kill Point. Howevenr <b>attacking someone is prohibited</b>. Only friendly Duels are allowed. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that someone will break the rules and attack someone, so be very careful when farming on those days, or give up farming outside the Alliance Resource Center. There is not possibility that the resources to heal your troops will be returned in the event of getting attacked from such bad guy.

<b><color=red><size=24>If you attack someone with no reason</size></color></b>
<b>The excuse is not valid</b>. You will be kicked out of the alliance and blacklisted. That means you get zeroed and you could be treated as a free kill point.

Enjoy MGE carefully :)
