<b><color=#246089><size=30>We won the Ark of Osiris!</size></color></b>
The Ark of Osiris was held Saturday and we won it due to everyones great works! Congrats everyone! 
One of our officers, <b><color=purple>RonParrot</color></b>, spent a lot of time thinking about strategy of Osiris, wrote an email and delivered it.  But <b>none of the enemies participated</b> in battle field :( The enemies may have been aware of his efforts and feared it. Lets hope they don’t laugh at our hero’s effort ;)

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Lost Kingdom has been unlocked</size></color></b>
But as far as I can see from the Kingdom Mail, they haven’t give everyone permission yet. As the email sent by <b><color=purple>Rabbit</color></b>, member other than the two alliances are prohibited from entering the Lost Kingdom without permission. so <b><color=red>DON’T ENTER Lost Kingdom yet!</color></b>

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Development of zone 1 has almost completed</size></color></b>
After it, we just need to slowly acquire the resource point that can be obtained with only one flag with one troop building. Let’s take this opportunity to earn individual coins. <b>The upper limit is 20k points a day</b>, so please don’t forget to call back troops with 20k points!

Happy gaming <3
