I'm sorry I've been away so long. 
By the way, who remembers this irregular news letter? I am very glad that I didn't make the title of this letter "daily/weekly news". because I sent this letter only once, it was July 14th. The name of "Monthly letter" might be fit to this news letter. xD

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Both of GOK and Lotus side began to move to make an agreement</size></color></b>
As in the mail of the kingdom which <b><color=purple>Azrael</color></b> sent, we are now trying to make an agreement with each other to make this kingdom a peaceful kingdom. We are thinking that we try to make deepen friendship with each other members first. so we may come and go each other, so please accept and greet them if you notice them. if someone you don't like participates, It's okay that you just ignore without criticizing him. please behave as adult not KIDs.
In any case, as stated in that mail, all attacks on people were prohibited while we are negotiating. In the meantime, <b>let's all grow up peacefully</b>!

<b><color=#246089><size=30>All <color=purple>Rabbits</color> got sinner title at same time</size></color></b>
There were four <b><color=purple>rabbits</color></b> in the kingdom. All of them got sinner title and as that result, they monopolized almost all sinner titles. Do you all know that there are six kinds of sinner title? So he made two new small rabbits, and tried to monopolize all sinner titles, but his attempt failed because the King remove sinner title from all rabbits. :(

Happy gaming <3
