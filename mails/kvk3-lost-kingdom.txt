<b><color=red><size=30>Very Important Announcement</size></color></b>
I realized <b>many people don't read alliance mails</b>. If you have any questions about the contents of the email or the rules of the alliance, please do not neglect to check with the executives. <b>It is both your fault to overlook email and to fail to confirm any unclear points</b> in email. Not surprisingly, <color=red>not having checked mails can't be any excuse, it's just your fault.</color>

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Lost Kingdom</size></color></b>
Lost Kingdom will be opend tomorrow. However, that does not mean that everyone is allowed to enter the lost kingdom. First of all, an alliance will be announced that you can enter the Lost Kingdom by  kingdom mail. In addition, only members permitted by the leader of that alliance can enter there.
28LG will enter Lost Kingdom from the beginning, but <b><color=red>only rank 3 members can enter at first</color></b>. Of course, when unauthorized members enter there, they are immediately expelled and severely punished without hearing any excuses. I'm tired to hear that any people tell other people playing and devices being hacked, something something :(((
In addition, the rank of those who did not contribute anything at the Alliance Mobilization has been lowered, so some of the people who used to be Rank 3 are Rank 2. If you enter a place without realizing it after committing the crime of failing to confirm it, you will also be severely punished.

<b><color=#246089><size=30>Why limit the number of people</size></color></b>
The alliance's resources are increased by mining the resource nodes in the territory. However, until they have enough territory in Lost Kingdom, they also need members who contribute to the alliance's resources by mining at Home Kingdom. Those who have contributed nothing to the mobilization of the alliance should do so.

After having sufficient territory in Lost Kingdom, we will announce to permit everyone to enter it. Until then, please contribute enough to the alliance at Home Kingdom.
